## P0 — Freeze the benchmark and reproduce the baseline

- **OBJECTIVE:** immutable BEFORE manifest; baseline reproduced; master plan written.
- **FILES EXPECTED TO CHANGE:** `remediation/scripts/freeze-baseline.mjs`, `remediation/baseline-manifest.json`, `remediation/baseline-summary.md`, `remediation/PLAN.md`, `remediation/benchmark-validity-exceptions.md`, `evidence/rigorrun-test-remediation-baseline.log`. No product code.
- **TESTS TO RUN:** `pnpm test` (full), `node remediation/scripts/freeze-baseline.mjs --check`, `node scripts/aggregate-results.mjs --check`.
- **BENCHMARK IMPACT EXPECTED:** none.
- **RISKS:** none.
- **ACTUAL FILES CHANGED:** as listed.
- **TEST RESULTS:** `pnpm test` → 73 files, 847/847 passed (24.45 s) on HEAD `07dda8c` (`evidence/rigorrun-test-remediation-baseline.log`); manifest check OK (58 cases, 108 frozen files); aggregate check OK (24 numbers, 0 mismatches).
- **ENVIRONMENT:** branch `redesign/brand-site-product`, HEAD `07dda8c738d6daada161ffcf2bfc046b3c874ac5`, workspace version 0.2.0, Node v22.22.2, pnpm 11.7.0, Linux 6.19.14+kali-amd64; git status before work: `.gitignore` modified (adds `tmp/`), `reports/` untracked. Audit stacks still running: rr-audit-greenmail, rr-audit-mailhog, rr-audit-worktide-{app,database,valkey}; Ollama serving qwen2.5:3b and llama3.1:8b.
- **REPRODUCTION RESULT:** baseline numbers re-derived from artefacts match `results.json` exactly (TP 10 / TN 0 / FP 6 / FN 10 / injected 0/3 by RigorRun).
- **BENCHMARK RESULT:** n/a.
- **NEW ISSUES DISCOVERED:** `findings.json` counts EM-GM-06 as an injected case whose oracle passed (the retry never happened); the manifest therefore lists 6 known-good graded cases, all FP, with that case footnoted.
- **STATUS:** DONE
